# 🕷️🕸️ Web scraping
## overview
Enough of learning let's get something done for the next 8 days. Here i will be planning, writing down my thought processes and my way of working day be day. In 8 days for next 3 hours a day I must lock myself in my room for this particular project.
### What i will be doing?
1. I will brainstorm and scrape some of the web-pages.
2. I will clean the scrapped data with my learning of excel as well as pandas.
3. I will store those cleaned data in SQL programatically.
4. I will visualize the data extracting valuable insights using python's matplotlib.

# 🔏 Day-1
✅ Brainstorm for project Idea
✅ Understanding of beautifulsoup
✅ Finding page to scrape the data 
✅ Project initiation

So I read couple of blogs that it is difficult to run crawler in big company's site because of their anti-bot system. However, let's setup every thing and try Nike's shoes section scraping.

I have no idea so far how does it work. However let's get started with it. So for that, i am gonna have to start new file app.py --> my main project file i guess. and install the dependecies. So for now let's just get request and beautifulsoup and will see from there.

Well, i have scraped html bit no way this makes any sense at this moment.

At first i thought the html soup object i was printing in console is what i have to deal with however it is not. we can actually parse as the browser what we see in the browser.

to windup todays lesson lets create a csv file programmatically and add the  findings in there. and also the url seems pretty dynamic we have to figureout the way to store it somewhere dynamically.

Well done for scraping data from nike's store, for now the data seems pretty clean. it is just the basic process will figure out the task for tomorrow.
